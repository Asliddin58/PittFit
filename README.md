## Overview

PittFit is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) that gives Pitt students a single place to:

- Check live Rec Center occupancy before making the trip
- Find exactly where equipment is on each floor
- Build and track personalized workout plans
- Reserve fitness rooms for clubs or groups
- View hours, announcements, and sports equipment availability

## Architecture

PittFit uses a **Layered Architecture with Client/Service Separation**.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         React Native Mobile App            │
│      (User Dashboard · Admin Panel)        │
└───────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────────┬───┘
        │          │          │         │
        ▼          ▼          ▼         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Python Flask REST API             │
│  Auth · Booking · Workout · Support         │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                       │
              ┌────────▼────────┐
              │   PostgreSQL    │
              │   (AWS RDS)     │
              └─────────────────┘
```

### Design Goals

| Goal | Metric | Technology Supporting It |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | User-facing actions < 2 seconds; occupancy refreshes within 30 seconds | Flask async endpoints, React Native local caching |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime during Rec Center operating hours | AWS auto-scaling and managed RDS |
| Data Consistency | Zero double bookings | PostgreSQL transactions and constraints |
| Usability | Common tasks in 3 clicks or fewer | React Native component reuse, clean navigation |
| Scalability | 30,000+ concurrent users | AWS horizontal scaling, stateless Flask services |

### Key Domain Classes

`User` · `Admin` · `PittRecCenter` · `RecCenterRoom` · `Equipment` · `WorkoutTemplate` · `WorkoutLog` · `RoomBooking` · `SupportTicket` · `Announcement`

## Branching Model

PittFit uses **GitHub Flow** adapted for Scrum sprints with a protected `main` branch and short-lived feature branches.

### Branch Structure

```
main                        ← production-ready code only
│
├── develop                 ← integration branch for each sprint
│   │
│   ├── feature/pitt-sso-login
│   ├── feature/occupancy-display
│   ├── feature/workout-templates
│   ├── bugfix/booking-double-entry
│   └── chore/update-readme
│
└── release/sprint-N        ← cut from develop at sprint end
```

### Branch Naming Convention

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | `feature/<description>` | `feature/room-booking` |
| Bug fix | `bugfix/<description>` | `bugfix/occupancy-refresh-crash` |
| Chore / docs | `chore/<description>` | `chore/add-sprint4-diagrams` |
| Release | `release/sprint-<n>` | `release/sprint-4` |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/<description>` | `hotfix/login-null-pointer` |

### Rules

1. **`main` is protected** — direct pushes are blocked; all merges require a PR with at least 1 approved review.
2. **`develop` is the sprint integration branch** — all feature branches are cut from `develop` and merged back via PR.
3. **Feature branches are short-lived** — merge within the same sprint; sync from `develop` if a branch runs long.
4. **PRs must pass CI checks** before merging (linting, tests).
5. **At sprint end**, `develop` is merged into `release/sprint-<n>` for the demo, then into `main`.
6. **Hotfixes** branch from `main` and merge back into both `main` and `develop`.

### Commit Message Format

```
feat: add real-time occupancy display
fix: prevent double booking on concurrent requests
docs: update architecture diagram for sprint 4
chore: configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline
refactor: extract booking validation to service layer
test: add unit tests for WorkoutTemplate class
```
